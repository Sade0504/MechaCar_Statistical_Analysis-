# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis-
Statistical analysis of automobile performance with R

## Overview
AutosRUs has a new prototype named "the MechaCar". The company is having production issues with the manufacturing team's progress and has asked my data analytics team to review their production data. The main objective of this project is to:

* Identify which variables predict the MPG for vehicle prototypes;
* Collect summary Statistics on the PSI of the suspension coils;
* Determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
